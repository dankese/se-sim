You can upload files directly to this repository (repo) and we can have all of our code in one place. If you want to make a change, open a file and start editing it. You'll be given two options: commit to master branch or create a new branch and submit a pull request. If you're working on a section of the project that is collaborative (we're all working on it) submit a pull request. This will keep all of our "changes" in different branches, and when we finally "pull" them together all changes are combined into one file.
